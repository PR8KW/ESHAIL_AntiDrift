Eshail Anti Drift Cat Control for RTL SDR using SDR CONSOLE version 2.3 build 3223.

I found this very good job from DL3HM for SDRPLAY and SDRUNO.

I try to use SDRUNO with "RTL-SDR V3", but option for Add VRX was not available.

So I change the original script to Control Sdr Console VFOA and VFOB, working fine with SDR Console 2.3.

Try to use with SDRConsole V3.0.5 but found problem to control VFOB when selected VFOA.

It's working fine in my PC, but litle bit complicated to configure.

Attached some pictures with configuration samples.

I am not a Programmer, so any programmer help are welcome.

If possible a Windows GUI software or plugin, with menus for audio channel and COM port selection, will be good.
